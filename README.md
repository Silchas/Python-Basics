### Details

# Prime Number Program
## Using for loop and if statements

### Details
<p>The Prime Number program iterates through all numbers through 1 to 100 and prints the prime numbers.</br>
The logic used is that prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).</br>
Thus, the first condition is to ensure that the numbers being checked are those greater than 1.</br>
The other logic is to divide the number by itself with no remainders with the modulus operator and have the numbers that satisfy the two conditions printed.</p>
